To start testing the gps feature what I would do first is to generate
a list of mocked coordinates as basis.

Next is I would use the Geocode api to convert for example
"SM PASSI CITY" to its respective coordinates.

since the geocode api would return a json It would just be easy write tests.

for example:

function geocodeFunction (query)
    // use geocode api
    return results

expect(geocodeFunction('SM PASSI CITY")).toEqual ("123.456, 456,123")

or this could be reversed by using also using google's reverse geocode
the function would be modified to accept coordinates then it would return an 
addresss

Then I would test if the map renders correctly by using the
React testing-libary.

I would assign first a test-id to the map component then I would run a test

expect(queryByTestId('map-component')).toBeTruthy.

In mobile there are many ways to mock a location and
if you are using android studio to emulate an android phone
they have built in mock locations.
